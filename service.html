              For my Eagle Scout Project, I rennovated several campsites at 
              <a class="default-link" href="https://lake-grapevine.com/murrell-park/">Murrell Park</a>—one 
              of the parks on Lake Grapevine, a local lake—following bad flood damage from the
              previous year.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rennovation primarily consisted of remmoving fire rings that were 
              currently installed and installing large metal cooktop grills in their place, 
              but we also cleaned up debris and cleared brush from the sites.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I facilited this entire project and, in coordination with the National Government
              (<a class="default-link" href="https://www.usace.army.mil/">US Army Corps of Engineers</a>), 
              created a proposal, researched key processes, drafted plans, and ultimately lead the execution 
              of this service project. The total amount of time spent by individuals on this project is 
              estimated to be more than 450 hours and on execution day I had more than 40 volunteers show up to help.

              I volunteered for this service project during the Winter of 2021, while I was 
              home from college. This project involved improving one of the local mountain 
              biking trails along the lake, which I frequently rode all the time growing up. 
              The existing bridge across this revine had fallen into disrepair and was unstable, 
              so I volunteered as a participant to help remove the existing bridge and build a new 
              one in its place.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              These trails are frequently used by the residents of my hometown and even many people in the 
              greater DFW area travel to hike and bike along these trails with a scenic view of the lake. 
              This service project was great service to the local community and provided much needed assistance 
              to the trail maintainers and Town government, and will be enjoyed for many years to come.
