              My Intership at <a class="default-link" href="https://www.bohmtechnologies.com/">Bohm Technologies</a>
              during the Summer of 2022 was a great experience. The project that was the primary focus of my internship 
              was to upgrade their online marketplace, <a class="default-link" href="https://www.a4c.com">A4C.com</a>, 
              and make it more user-freindly, modern looking, and responsive. I redisgned the theme of 
              the website entirely, and improved the way that data was sent to the page; adding additional 
              filters so users could filter the products to their liking.

              This project was my first introduction to software engineering in a professional environment, 
              as I had to manage a project timeline, familarize myself with the required technologies, 
              and present regular updates to superiors. In the process 
              I learned many different technologies for web developement, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
              in addition to learning Shopify's own <a class="default-link" href="https://shopify.dev/api/liquid">Liquid Template Language</a>.

              During the fall of my Junior year at Texas A&M, I took a class for Computer Engineers 
              called "Computer Architechture"; in which, the labs had us focusing on designing a processor. 
              This semester-long project was completed during lab time and culminated in the design and 
              simulation of a processor capable of running a subset of ARMv8 Assembly. 
              (<a class="default-link" href="https://github.com/colemcanelly/ECEN350_Labs">Repository</a>)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              During this project I learned how to write ARM assembly and integrate it with 
              compiled C code, and furthered my knowledge of VerilogHDL and concepts surrounding 
              circuit design. The first few weeks were spent learning assembly, and the remainder 
              of the semester was spent describing various components of our processor in Verilog 
              and using unit tests we had written to ensure our components integrity. Finally, we were 
              able to integrate and simulate all of the components where we could insert assembled code 
              into the instruction memory and run various programs.
