              Throughout my education at Texas A&M, I have been given many 
              opportunities—inside and outside of class—to further my experience with various technologies. 
              My first experience with programming, and computer science in general, was 
              with Python; I took an introductory class freshman year and continue to use it outside of 
              class for mathematical proofs, side projects, and to further my understanding of algorithms. 
              I have taken 3 classes that have used C/C++ as their primary language, and consider myself 
              to be fairly comfortable in these lower-level languages. Other languages/technologies that 
              classes have covered include; Java, Haskell, SQL, PHP, ARMv8 Assembly, and BASH Script.
            </p>

              Outside of school, an internship during the summer of 2022 provided me with an amazing 
              opportunity to gain more experience. I spent the summer learning the basics of web 
              development and became comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and additionally 
              learned a great deal about Shopify's Liquid Template Language. I continue to practice 
              with these technologies to become more familiar with full-stack development, in fact, 
              this website was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! While I have learned a lot 
              since coming to Texas A&M, I am not done learning; I like to adopt a mindset of constant 
              learning otherwise I would get bored.
            </p>

              Luckily for me, Computer Science is such a broad field with so many applications, it 
              would be fairly difficult to get bored. While I can see the many applications of my 
              major and the various routes I could go with it, I admit that I still struggle to know 
              exactly which field I want to pursue after graduation. This is the primary reason for 
              my interest in software consulting—as a consultant, you work on projects for such a wide 
              variety of clientele that you can learn more about what areas of computer science you enjoy, 
              and which you don't. I also enjoy working with others, and by doing consulting I would put 
              myself in an environment where working with others is an everyday event: I would get 
              opportunities to discuss projects with both clients and coworkers. This prospect of a wide 
              variety of projects and the emphasis on social interaction makes consulting my main area of 
              interest in the field of computer science, and something I believe I would like to do 
              upon graduation from Texas A&M University.
