              One of my favorite activities is snow skiingâ€”I have been skiing with my 
              family since I was around 2 years old, and I go whenever I can. My family 
              and I have skied all over Colorado and New Mexico, and for many years 
              coordinated a church ski trip.

              This specific picture was taken at Breckenridge, CO in January of 2023 from one 
              of the chairlifts on Peak 9. My buddy and I were able to catch a short 3 day 
              trip before the spring semester started.

              I also just enjoy being outdoors in general. My friends and I have recently set out to visit as many 
              national parks as we can, and recently took a trip to south Texas and were able to go to
              Carlsbad Caverns, White Sands, and Guadelupe Mountains National Parks over the summer of 2022.

              The day we went out to <a class="default-link" href="https://www.nps.gov/whsa/index.htm">White Sands National Park</a> 
              there happened to be a full lunar eclipse that night, so we brought my roommates telescope and were able to enjoy 
              God's creation under a sky full of stars. This picture specifically was taken on 
              my phone using "Night photography", and is really visually stunning.

              One of the coolest experiences of my life was the backpacking trip that I took with 
              my Dad, Brother, and a few friends to hike roughly 115 miles of the Continental Divide 
              in Colorado between Pagosa Springs and Silverton. We decided during COVID that we were tired 
              of being cooped up inside all day and planned this trip to the remote isolation of the Weminuche Wilderness.

              After I graduated in May 2020, I wasn't sure that I was going to have anything to do 
              over the summer, but this trip served as a "Senior Trip" of sorts and helped make COVID feel 
              more normal. We trained and planned for several months before going and it was extremely strenuous, 
              but it was an experience I will never forget and gave me memories to cherish for a lifetime.
